The file /smart_monitoring/src/models/anomaly_model.pkl is a binary file that stores the trained machine learning model for anomaly detection. As such, it cannot be represented as text content. You would typically generate this file by training your model using a machine learning library like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, and then saving it using a method like `joblib.dump()` or `pickle.dump()`.

Since I cannot create binary files directly, please ensure that you have trained your model and saved it to this path using the appropriate method in your code. If you need help with that process, let me know!
