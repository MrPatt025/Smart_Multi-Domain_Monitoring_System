# Smart Multi-Domain Monitoring System

## Overview
The Smart Multi-Domain Monitoring System is an intelligent surveillance and data analysis platform that integrates multiple domains, including IoT, real-time data processing, machine learning, and web development. The system is designed to monitor various environmental parameters and detect anomalies using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **IoT Integration:** Collects data from sensors (real or simulated) such as temperature, humidity, light, and motion using secure protocols (MQTT over TLS, HTTPS).
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Processes incoming data in real-time using asynchronous programming or multi-threading, ensuring efficient handling of large data streams.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) to detect anomalies in the data, with automatic retraining capabilities.
- **Web Dashboard:** Provides an interactive web dashboard for real-time data visualization and alerts, built with Flask (or FastAPI) and JavaScript frameworks (React/Vue).
- **Cybersecurity Measures:** Implements security protocols including HTTPS, JWT for authentication, and strict input validation to protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd smart_monitoring
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and updating the values as needed.

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Access the web dashboard at `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).
- Use the API endpoints to interact with the system and retrieve data.
